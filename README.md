Apache Jmeter Distro
--------------------

This project takes apache jmeter distribution from mirror downloads for distribution using maven central.

For more information on jmeter, please see [jmeter](https://github.com/apache/jmeter)

# Motivation #

Apache Jmeter does not currently provide a maven central distribution of the entire project. This project aims to solve that by providing users an alternative location to pull rather than the various apache mirror sites.
